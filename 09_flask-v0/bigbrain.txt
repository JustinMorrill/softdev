K09 -- First Flask App
2021-10-01

Q0: This looks a lot like a Java constructor, so this is probably creating a
new instance of the Flask class.

Q1: In a filesystem, "/" refers to the root directory, so this is probably the
equivalent of the root path for @app.route.

Q2: This will print to the console.

Q3: This will appear in the webpage returned at the root path, accessible from
localhost (127.0.0.1). Flask works by calling the associated method
under the @app.route decorator and returns the result as HTML.

Q4: The dot notation means that run() is a method of app, our instance of the
Flask class.

New Notes:
Viewing the page source shows that the source is literally only the words "No
hablo queso!", without HTML tags or anything else. The webserver only returns
what is returned in the hello_world function.
